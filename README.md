# Three-Dimensional Virtual Model of the Human Temporal Bone

<h3>Background </h3><p>Computed Tomography (CT) scanning offers an accurate structural definition of bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues; however, mental integration of cross-sectional 2D CT images for a 3D understanding of complex anatomical structures becomes difficult when the field of view is confined to the temporal bone. This project tried to provide a feasible solution to this problem by creating a navigable 3D virtual model which may aid in better comprehension of the temporal bone anatomy.</p>
<h3>Methods </h3><p>A helical-CT scan was used to obtain high-resolution cross-sectional slices of a cadaveric human temporal bone. Using the volume-rendering capabilities of 3D Slicer<sup>®</sup>, which involves volume data management, cropping of the data set, and threshold painting, detailed anatomical structures were segmented based on the intensity captured from different regions. This volumetric data was converted to an interactive virtual model using Blender<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<h3>Results </h3><p>The final product is a web page that allows interaction and navigation with a 3D annotated model of the temporal bone, which can be accessed from any device with a web browser.</p>
<h3>Conclusion </h3><p>This model can function as a training tool for students, teachers, and practitioners to understand and review the complex anatomy of the temporal bone.</p>
